colors:
In CSS, colors can be represented in following ways:
    1) Color keywords
    2) Hexadecimal notation:
            The hex code consists of a hash(#) symbol followed by six characters. These six characters are arranged into a set of three pairs (RR, GG, and BB).
            Each character pair defines the intensity level of the colour, where R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue.
            The intensity value lies between 00 (no intensity) and ff (maximum intensity).

            Breaking the Character Set (RRGGBB):
                RR: RR defines the intensity of color red, ranging from 00 (no red) to FF (maximum red).
                GG: GG defines the intensity of color Green, with values from 00 (no green) to FF (full green).
                BB: GG defines the intensity of color Blue, varying from 00 (no blue) to FF (full blue).
    3) RGB
        RGB stands for “Red, Green, Blue,” and it defines the colour value by taking three (red, green, blue) arguments.
        Each argument value lies between 0 and 255.
    4) RGBA
        Similar to RGB, in RGBA, a stands for alpha value, which defines the opacity of the color. The alpha value lies between 0 and 1.
    5) HSL
        HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. This is another way to set colour properties.

        Breaking each keyword:

        Hue(h)
            Hue represents the type of color. It is measured in degrees, and its value lies from 0 to 360.
            0 degree represents black, 120 degree is for green, and 360 degree is for blue.
        Saturation (S):
            Saturation controls the intensity or purity of the color. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
            0% saturation is no color (grayscale),  and 100% saturation is the most intense colour.
        Lightness (L):
            Lightness determines how light or dark the colour is. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
            0% lightness represents pure black, 50% lightness represents normal colour, and 100% lightness is pure white.
