The Cascade Algorithm:
    The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element.
    Rules of this algorithm:

    1. Position and order of appearance in case of same type of selector
    2. Specificity: It determines which CSS selector has the strongest match. 
        The order of specificity is:
            Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector
    3. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type.
            It can override the inline style also.


Specificity Calculation:
To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

    Universal Selector: 0
    Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
    Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
    ID selectors: 100
    Inline styles: 1000

    Here, selector with more specificity will be applied if same then the selector which comes later will be applied
    Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector.

    !important at the end of a CSS value gets a specificity score of 10,000 points. 
    This is the highest specificity that one individual item can get.
