CSS Units
    => CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
    => Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
    
    There are two types of length units:
    1. Absolute units:
        => The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
        => Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much.
                cm - centimetres (1 cm = 37.8 px)
                mm - millimetres
                in - inches (1 in = 96 px = 2.54cm)
                px - pixel (1px = 1/96th of 1 in)
                pt - points (1pt = 1/72th of 1 in)
                pc - picas (1pc = 12 pt)
    
    2. Relative units:
        em - Relative to the font size of the parent element. Eg: 5em means the size would be 5 times the current font size.
        ex - Relative to X height of the existing font
        ch - Relative to the width/ radius of the character “0”.
        rem - Relative to the font size of the root element.
        vw - Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport. (Viewport is the area of the website visible to the user.)
        vh -  Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
        vmin - Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
        vmax - Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension
        % - Relative to the parent element’s size.
