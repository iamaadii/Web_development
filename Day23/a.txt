for converting any block level element into inline we can use 
display: inline property

if we use padding,margin or border on the converted inline element that it will only add padding from left, right and bottom not from top.
we cannot also set width, and height of a inline element for that we have to set display: inline-block

if we want to add margin, padding and border from top on the converted inline element for that we have to change display property to inline-block

display:none for removing content along with space.
visibility:hidden for removing only content not space.
display:flex and justify-content:center for alligning content in the center
