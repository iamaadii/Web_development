flexbox: 
    Flexbox is a layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.
    Flexbox is short for the Flexible Box Layout module.


Flexbox Components: A flexbox always consists of:
    a Flex Container - the parent (container) <div> element
    Flex Items - the items inside the container <div>


The CSS properties we use for the flex container are:
    flex-direction
    flex-wrap
    flex-flow
    justify-content
    align-items
    align-content


flex-direction: 
    It specifies the display-direction of flex items in the flex container
    The flex-direction property can have one of the following values:
        row: It is the default value, and it displays the flex items horizontally (from left to right)
        column: It displays the flex items vertically (from top to bottom)
        row-reverse: It displays the flex items horizontally (but from right to left)
        column-reverse: It displays the flex items vertically (but from bottom to top)

flex-wrap:
    It specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not, if there is not enough space for them on one flex line.
    The flex-wrap property can have one of the following values:
        nowrap: It specifies that the flex items will not wrap (this is default)
        wrap: It specifies that the flex items will wrap if necessary
        wrap-reverse: It specifies that the flex items will wrap if necessary, in reverse order

flex-flow: It is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties
    Example: flex-flow: row wrap;

justify-content:
    It is used to align the flex items when they do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).
    The justify-content property can have one of the following values:
        center: It positions the flex items in the center of the container
        flex-start: It positions the flex items at the beginning of the container (this is default)
        flex-end: It flex-end value positions the flex items at the end of the container
        space-around: It displays the flex items with space around them
        space-between: It displays the flex items with space between them
        space-evenly: It displays the flex items with equal space around them
