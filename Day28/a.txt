By default position of any element is static. It means we can not add top, bottom, left, right, z-index on it

position: relative; means now we can use top,bottom,left,right,and z-index property
top: 50px; means move element towards down 50px.
left: 10px; means move element towards right 10px.
z-index:2; for appearing any element over another element...element whose z-index index is greater will be shown over another element.


transform, filter or perspective properties can also make an element appear as positioned
transform: translate(0);
filter:invert(0)
perspective: 0em;


Position Property
    The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
    There are five different position values:
        static:
            HTML elements are positioned static by default.
            Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

        relative:
            Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. 

        fixed:
            It means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

        absolute:
            An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
            However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
 
        sticky:
            An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
            A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
